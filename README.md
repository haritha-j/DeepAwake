# DeepAwake

The purpose of this project is to detect the drowsiness level of drivers in real time using a RGB-D image feed.

The proposed system would utilize two neural networks to monitor two different parameters.
a. Head pose
b. Eye state

By combining the output of the above networks, a score would be calculated to determine the drowsiness of the driver. If the score exceeds a threshold value, the driver would be alerted.
